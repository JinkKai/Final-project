    <p class="two">The fourth member and the sniper of the Straw Hats. He was once doing ship repair when no one 
        is able to. Usopp loves to make lies. You can see it by his significant long nose. However, the story 
        behind it was his father leaves him and his mother alone and became a pirate. His mom was sick, so Usopp 
        had to make tales and even lies to make her happy. After her mom died, he make lies to Kaya, the girl whom he loves.
        But he said it was not a lie because one day he will fulfill all of the words he made. He was scared and timid always, 
        but he faced Kuro, the man who wants to kill Kaya, and fight will all his might.
    </p>
    <p>Actually Usopp refused to go with Luffy at first, but with Kaya's approval and giving them a new and large ship called Merry,
        Usopp agreed. Through all the jouneys and voyages they had, Merry's condition is getting worse and worse. 
        Even with the repair of Usopp but it still gets worn off. Finally at Water 7 where Merry's keel broke and can't 
        be repaired anymore. Usopp has no power to repair it because his ability were not enough. Luffy made a hard decision to
        abandon Merry and buy a new ship. Usopp disagreed and fought with Luffy. Obviously he lose, and he left the crew. 
        But when he heard that Robin was in danger and Luffy was being beaten by CP9, he still wants to help them.
        So he disguise himself into another person and helped Luffy in all his fight. But 
        his disguise skills were so poor that everyone recognizes him except Luffy and Chopper. 
    </p>
    <p>When they won the battle against CP9, they were surrounded by the navy and they had no ship to escape.
        This was the time that Merry set sail on himself alone becuase through the love and care of the Straw Hats 
        before, he grew a soul. Merry comes and take them away, but Merry use all of its strength and finally 
        broke apart. Everyone cried in the cremation of Merry and it is one of the most tear-inudcting scence
        in whole One Piece. 
    </p>
    <p>Usopp agreed and accepted their new ship and rejoins the group. He is timid and wants to get off any possible harm and troubles, 
        but he grows in being courageous and brave.
