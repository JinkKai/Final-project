    <p class="two">Robin is the seventh memeber and the archaeologist of the crew. Her life is the most miserable among the crew.
        Because the island she lives on is the home of archaeology, the people there, including Robin, were passion in 
        knowing the past, yet the government dislike it. Nine hundred years before, the world were differnt, and the founders 
        of the government now, the celestial dragons, usurps the throne and rule the world. They erased the 
        history of the 100 years where the original kingdom is present. However, the real kingdom 
        write all their history on many huge stones about the truth and many mysteries in secret langugae. 
        And Robin's hometown can decode the message so the government sent one admiral and five vice admiral to 
        wipe out every people and every document in the island. Robin was the only one survived. She was saved 
        by Aokiji, the admiral in the future, becuase he sees Akainu, vice admiral at that time, kills everyone 
        including those who don't know the secret.  
    </p>
    <p>Robin then has a bountry of tens on million because of his ability in decoding the secret of the government.
        She later was used by Crocodile in decoding and joined Luffy's crew later. She feel no place for her until she was in 
        Luffy's crew especailly when Luffy and his crew still wants to save him despise of being an enemy with the whole government.
        She was touched and accepts them. Aokiji met her secretly and congrats her in finding such good peoples. 
        Her ability now is crucial as Luffy is getting near to the last island. She will still have new story waiting for her.
