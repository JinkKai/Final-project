    <p class="two">Chopper was the sixth member and the doctor of the crew. He is not a person but a deer. 
        He ate the devil fruit of hito-hito that makes him looks a little bit like human and knows human language.
        But he is lonely, he was abandoned by his family becuase of being weak. Hiriluk accepts him and cures his 
        wound. Hiriluk is a doctor and treated him just like human and teaches him all the skills he had. 
        It was Hiriluk that reshapes his life and make him what he is today. Unfortunately, Hiriluk was 
        killed by Dalton, an evil king. When Luffy heard that, he sent Dalton flying and ask him to join his crew.
        It was at here that Chopper didn't feel any discrimination.

    <p>Chopper was able to use his ability into different types of form in dealing with different types 
        of battle. He was known of being cute, low in bounty becuase the navy thought it was their pet, 
        and will dance when someone praises him.
