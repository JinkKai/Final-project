        Brook is the eighth memebr and the musician of the crew. He was famous decades ago when 
        Gold D. Roger was a rookie. Years ago, he had a promise with Laboon, a whale at the Reverse Mountain, 
        that he will finish the voyage and come back to see him again. He didn't fulfill his promise becuase 
        he died in a battle. Fortunately, due to his ability, he came back to life but in a skeleton form. 
        He sailed into the territory of Moria and his shadow was taken by him. If a person doesn't have shadow, 
        when he face the sun, he will be burned into ashes. Brook have no choice but to live in Thriller Bark, 
        a place where sunlight seldom visit. Things come to a change when he meets Luffy. Luffy was surprised of 
        his figure and was amazed, so he invited him. When Luffy hears his story, he tell him that he met 
        Laboon also, big and wounded becuase he wants to break the mountain to see Brook. Brook cried but Luffy 
        gives me comfortat that he beats Laboon and made a new and the same promise as Brook has. 
    </p>
    <p>After Moria is defeated by Luffy, everyone's shadow comes back to their own body. Brook now then 
        joins Luffy and his crew to fulfill Luffy's will and to keep the promise with Laboon. 
    </p>
    <p>Brook is famous for his skeletal figure, weird jokes about bones, wants to see ladie's pants, 
        a musician, and a strong swordsman.
