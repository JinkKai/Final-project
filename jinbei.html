    <p class="two">The ninth member and the wheelman of the crew. He is now currently a candidate of the strongest 
        crew memeber other than Zoro and Sanji. Being the former Shichibukai and a friend of Ace, Jinbei 
        was put into Impel Down becuase he refused to join the navy to fight against Whitebeard.
        After Jinbei learn that Luffy was the brother of Ace and had heard his story from Ace, Jinbei begged 
        Luffy to release him to help Luffy. During the battle of the Marineford, Jinbei has helped and saved 
        Luffy many times. He even protected Luffy against the puch of Admiral Akainu, the Logia type of lava, 
        when Luffy fainted after Ace died in front of his face. He got the lava punch right through his chest,
        but he still roars against Akainu before he fainted. Luckily, Marco, the first commander of Whitebeard's 
        Pirate came and push Akainu back. 
    </p>
    <p>After the battle, Luffy and Jinbei was receiving treatment from Law. After they wake up, 
        Jinbei helped Luffy to overcome the extreme sadness of losing his brother and reminds him of 
        his crew that are scattered. Later Jinbei leaves. The next time they meet again is in the Fish-Man Island. 
        After seeing Luffy defeated Hody Jones and save the island from being destoryed, he had decided to become 
        one of the crew. During that time, Luffy is having hemorrage and needs blood transfusion. All the fish man 
        were reluctant in doing it because they were discriminated and treated as slave by the humans. 
        Humans hate them yet hunt for them to sell them as a pet of the celestial dragons. Even Luffy defeated Hody
        Jones, people still hesitate. It was at this time that Jinbei comes out and be the one to save Luffy.
        Not only he has the same blood type to Luffy, but his act diminishes the hate between the Fish man and the Straw Hats. 
    </p>
    <p>Luffy invited him to join after he wake up, but Jinbei said later because he had something to do. 
        The next time we see him was the in arc of Whole Cake Island where he became a subordinate of Big Mom. 
        Luffy learned that although he announce to Big Mom that Fish-Man island is his territory right now, Jinbei's original 
        priate crew was still under Big Mom's control. In the island, not only Luffy saved Sanji and destroy the wedding, 
        he also helped Jinbei's crew to leave so now Jinbei is officially the member of the Straw Hat's pirate. 
        When Luffy was fighting Katakuri, Jinbei and Sanji were the two who fought the most against Big Mom. 
        Jinbei even said this famous saying when facing Big Mom's deadly threat: <b>"I am a man who wants to be part of the future Pirate King's crew...
         I can't be intimidated by a mere Emperor of the Sea!"</b>
    </p>
    <p>They escaped Big Mom and later defeated Big Mom and Kaidou in the Wano Kingdom</p>
