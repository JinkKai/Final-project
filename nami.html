    <p class="two">The third and first female member of the group. Nami is the navigatior and the first crew member that betrayed Luffy.
        She take all the treasures of Luffy and escape back to his hometown. It turns out that she 
        was being threathened by Arlong, the fish-man. Arlong occupied the village since Nami's childhood,
        and forced her to draw the map in order to conquer the world.  She does because her mother
        was already killed. When she finish many maps, Arlong wants her to steal treasures which transforms
        her into loving money.
    </p>
    <p> Although she looks warm, but she is actually cold because no one can have a step in her heart especially
    when she was filled with hatred. But when Luffy came and promise her to defeat Arlong, Nami knows Luffy has 
    the ability and willing to help her. She cried and started to be warm all-out. She cried again when Arlong
    was really defeated which means her nightmare was gone.
    </p>
    <p>Although she loves money and looks like she treasures money more than anything, she showed her
        feelings toward other and are willing to help others even with giving up her money. This can be 
        shown from the only tree that they had on Luffy's ship: a orange tree, signifies the love toward her
        mother.
