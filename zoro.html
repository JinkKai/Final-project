    <p class="two">Being the first crew and the deputy captain, Zoro always stand on Luffy's back and 
        backs him up whenever Luffy is down or when the crew needs to be motivated. He is calm and 
        has intelligence. Being first called pirate hunter, he joined Luffy and became navy hunter. 
        He is a swordsman and one of the strongest in the crew after Luffy. Although he was intelligent
        and smart, he has one weakness which is have no sense of direction. No matter what the 
        situation may be, he can still walk another way and leave the crowd. This may be his talent.
    </p>
    <p>Just like Luffy, Zoro has his own dream which is to become the greatest swordsman in the world.
        When he saw Hawk Eye, the strongest swordsman in the world and has similar strength to
        the four emperors, he didn't step back because of 
        the huge gap of strength. Instead, he stands out and challenges Hawk Eye. He didn't fear him 
        even when he loses. This earns respect from Hawk Eye and he remembers him. He vowed that he he will
        never lose again. This is the only lose that Zoro had in one-to-one combat.
    </p>
    <p>Zoro's famous traits are green hair, three-sword style, keep on quarreling with Sanji,
         and having no sense of direction.
    </p>
    <p>The place where he shows he greatest charisma is when at Thriller Bark. When Luffy and others
        defeated Moria and Bartholemew Kuma come. Luffy fainted after the fight with Moria. The others
        are still awake and fight Kuma, but none of them can beat him, especially with the tiredness that 
        they experiencd after a fight. Kuma use his still to give a shock to the whole island. 
        Only Sanji and Zoro are still awake, and they beg to spare Luffy. Both of them said Kuma can 
        take his head. Zoro knock Sanji and beg to Kuma. Kuma gave him an opportunity to endure all 
        the pain Luffy had during the fight with Moria. Using his ability, Kuma was able to extract
        all the physical pain from Luffy and gave it to Zoro. When Sanji get his senses, he found Zoro standing
        with blood everywhere. Yet Zoro said: <b> "Nothing every happened."</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        When he was sent flying to an island. He begged the owner there, Hawk Eye, to teach him sword skills 
        and be stronger to help Luffy and defeat him.
