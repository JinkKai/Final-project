    <p class="two">
        The whole story being with the execution of Gold D. Rodger, the king of pirates. When he was about 
        to be executed, he deliver his famous last word that explodes and creates the Great Pirate Era: 
        "
       <b> You want my treasure, you can have it I left everything I gathered together in one place.
         Now you'll just have to find it!.</b>"<br>
         Several year after in East Blue, young Luffy is begging Shanks, a pirate, to bring him
            as a crew member so Luffy can fuilfill his dream of being a pirate king
            , yet Shanks refuse becuase of Luffy's age. Upset, Luffy ate a fruit
            of Shanks. When Shanks saws it, he pull him over but his hands stretched to an abornmal length!
            Turns out Luffy was eating a devil fruit. Devil fruit, in One Piece's worldview, 
            is a cursed fruit. Until now, no one knows where it came from. It is only known that those 
            who eat the devil's fruit gain abilities from different fruits
             but are cursed by the sea. The devil frutit eater will never be able to swim.
         
       Devil fruit can be classified into three general forms: Paramecia, offers strange abilities;
            Zoan, allows users to turn into animals and got feautures of animals; and Logia, allows users
            to control certain type of natural elements. The name of Luffy's devil fruit is Gomu-gomu fruit
            which gives his body characteristics of rubber that can stretch and can use this abiity
            to attack. 
        </p>
        <p>When Shanks and his crew decide to leave Foosha Village, Luffy was kidnapped by bandits.
            During the process of saving Luffy, they fell into the sea, and a sea monster comes and eat
            the bandit. When the sea king want to eat Luffy who was drowing, Shanks saved him by
            suffering is right arm and scares the sea king away. When Shanks was about to leave,
            he gave Luffy his straw hat and promised with him that when they meet again, Luffy will return
            it back. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Several years later, Luffy was 17 years old and leave his home and set sail to become a pirate
            to fulfill his dream and promise. He met his first obstacle, Alvida. He set him
            flying using his ability and saved Coby. Coby also has his own dream which is to become navy admiral.
            Luffy respected him and made another promise with Coby. In the mean time, Luffy also rescured
            a pirate hunter, Zoro, and use his action to invite him to join his crew. After fighting
            side by side in defeating the bad guys, Zoro agreed. Now Luffy has a crew of two and his goal
            was to have a total of ten, excluding himself. 
        </p>
        <p>Luffy later goes into another island and defeated Buggy, a priate that reigns a village.
            Buggy is a devil fruit eater. He has the power of splitting his body into different 
            sizes of piece that protects him against slicing. But his feet can't be far away from the 
            rest of his body in a certain range. Luffy use this weakness to defeat him. Luffy also
            meets another future crew memebr, Nami, a thief. 
        </p>
        <p>This group of three went to another island and defeat another enemy, Kuro. This is the 
            first enemy that Luffy had a little bit hard time of. On the island, Luffy recruited Usopp,
            one who loves lying but later found out all his lies was to make his girfriend happy.
            When they were sailing, they found an restaurant on sea called Patty. On the same time,
            Krieg was being chased by Hawk Eye, one of the Shichibukai. Shichibukai is referring
            to seven pirates who serves a huge threat for the navy, so the navy recruited them to work
            for the navy. Hawk Eye is the strongest swordsman of the world. Zoro, being a swordsman also,
            always place Hawk Eye as his ultimate goal. He challenged Hawk Eye and losed easily, but Hawk
            Eye was moved by Zoro's determination and spared his life. Luffy defeted Krieg and
            recruited Sanji, the best chef in Patty, to be his memeber. However, one the same time,
            Nami escpaed with all the treasures of Luffy where is given by the people for thanks.
        </p>
        <p>Luffy didn't blame Nami; instead, they follow after Nami to her destination.
            There they found the reason behind the cause. Its becuase Arlong, the fishman pirate in Nami's village,
            wants the talent of Nami to draw nautical chart. So Arlong for her to draw charts or
            raise 1 billion berry orelse he'll destory her hometown. After knowing this, Luffy and his crew
            forgives Nami and helps Nami to fight Arlong and his cardes. After a fierce battle, Luffy won and
            regain Nami back to the crew.
        </p>
       <p>Now the went to the last island before the Reverse mountain, the entry to the Paradise and
        the place where Gold D. Rodger was executed.
        Over there, they meet Smoker, a just navy colonel. He is a devil fruit eater: Logia of smoke.
        This is the first opponent that Luffy can't even touch becuase he could turn his body into smoke
        whenever Luffy's punch come in contact. Fortunately, a strange person come and helped him.
        They were able to escape and enter the first half of their voyage: Paradise.
       </p>
       <p>
        Starting here, all the enemy is getting harder to fight with. They fight with Crocodile,
        another Shichibukai and wants to overthrow Arabasta. He is also a Logia of sand. Luffy was 
        defeated and heavily injured. At last, he found the weakness of sand which is water, so he punch
        with his blood to touch him and defeated him. Luffy's name was being know through the world and
        get the nickname "the Strawhat." Over there, Luffy recruited another two memebers: Chopper and
        Robin.
       </p>
       <p>After some other voyages and incidents, they went to Skypiea, an island above the 
        clouds. There they defeated Enel, a dictator of Skypiea who usurps the original king.
        Enel is also a Logia type of thunder. However, Luffy is rubber, which is a insulator of
        electricity. This arc was called the most romantic arc of all One Piece by the fans.
       </p>
       <p>
        When they were in Water 7, Robin betreayed them and lead CP9, a special agency of the government,
        to go against them. Then Robin set forth with CP9 to Enies Lobby. Luffy and his crew went there also
        very soon and fought a deadly fight. Luffy was able to upgrade his skills and ability to go into second
        and third gear to beat Lucci, the head of CP9. It is also at this point that they learn about Robin's past
        and reasons. They ask Robin to rejoin them inspite of these things and Robin finally overcomed her
        pity and sorrow. During the rescue of Robin, Franky was helping them so he was recruited to the 
        Straw Hat pirate and set sail to their next island: Thriller Bark.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Straw Hats pirate defeated another Shichibukai called Moria, a Paramecia of controlling shadow,
        in Thriller Bark. They also recruited another member called Brook, who was now a skeleton
        becuase he died alreay. But with the devil fruit of Paramecia of controlling soul, he was able to 
        regain his life. However, he took some time to find his corpse, and when he found it, it turned
        to skull already. 
       </p>
       <p>When they were in Sabaody Archipelego, other pirate that have taken different routes
        also gathered here because this is the last and only island before the New World. They
        will have to pass Red Line, a mountain barrier but there is only two way. One is to
        buy ticket from the Celestial Dragon palace that is ubove the mountain or use bubble coating
        to go into the underwater cave and go into the New World. For pirates, the second way is the only
        way. Introduced by a friend, Luffy and his crew went find Rayleigh to coat for them.
        During the process they found that Rayleigh was the former Pirate King's second hand. 
        It was also from Rayleigh that they know now in Sabaody have total of eleven pirates, including
        Luffy and Zoro, who has a bounty over one hundred million. They were called the worst generation.
        When the Straw Hats were having rest, they heard that their mermaid friend was being captured for an
        auction. They went and wanna buy her will all of their assets but a celestial dragon, the ruler of
        this world, buys her and treat the world as his slave. Luffy can't comprehend so he sent him flying.
        During this process, he fought together with Law and Kid, two of the worst generations.
        Because the celestial dragons were the ruler of the world and navy for 800 years, the navy sent 
        Admiral Kizaru to wipe all the pirates in Sabaody Archipelego. 
        Although the worst generation and all the pirates here are stong, they are no match for an admiral.
        Soon they were defeated and was separted into different places. 
       </p>
       <p>Luffy and his crew were sent flying by Bartholemew, a Shichibukai. He landed in Amazon Lily,
        a territory of a Shichibukai: Boa Hancock, the only female Shichibukai. Luffy didn't beat her
        but showed Conqueror's Haki, a new power system introduced in the story. Later knowing more about
        Hancock, they were later friends and Boa Hancock fall in love with him, but Luffy had no feeling for her,
        even though she was the most beautiful lady of the world. 
        Suddenly, Luffy heard a news from the newspaper that his sworn brother, Ace, was about to be executed
        by the navy publicly. He burst with anger. Although Ace was a Logia type of flame and the second
        commander in the White Beard Pirates, one of the four emperors of the sea, Luffy still wants to save him.
        Luffy convinced Hancock to join the convene of the navy for Shichibukai and went secretly into Impel Down to save
        Ace in the prison before he goes to the navy HQ. 
       </p>
       <p>Luffy failed to rescue Ace in Impel Down; however, he released Crocodile and Jinbei, both former
        Shichibukai, and others. They broke away from the prison and go forth navy headquarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        In preparation for the upcoming public execution of Ace and possible fight with the Whitebeard Pirate,
        fleet admiral Sengoku summoned one hundred thousand of navy eltes including all field and general officer.
        They also had  the strongest thee and only admiral and all other Shichibukai to prepare. Before the 
        execution, Sengoku announed to the whole world that Ace was the son of Gold D. Roger and then the Whitebeard Pirates 
        arrived with will his force about fifty thousand pirates including his sixteen commanded(without Ace).
        First and third commander, Marco and Jozu fight against the two admirals. Whitebeard is fighting with another 
        admiral and the rest of the navy. Soon Luffy and his forces come into the battle. In this place,
        Luffy is not strong at all and was beaten by Smoker, now the rear admiral. But he get Hancock's help and 
        the assist of the Whitebeard Pirates. After more fights, Luffy was able to rescue Ace, but Ace
        died with the fight of an admiral. Whitebeard was later killed by Blackbeard and stoled his ability of
        making earquake. Fleet Admiral come and fight with Blackbeard. During this time, Shanks, one of the four emperor step in and 
        ended the war. Before Whitebeard died, he proclaimed that one piece was true and was broadcasted to the whole
        world which stimulates the pirates of the whole world
       </p>
       <p>After days, Luffy was recovered and gradually accepted the truth. He use his way to tell
        his crew memebers across everywhere to train for two years becuase currently they are no match for the top Level

       </p>
       <p>After two years, they reunite and goes under the Red Line by coating. Under the sea Fish-Man
        island. They defeated Hody Jones and saved the royal family of the island. Finally they are in the new world.
       </p>
       <p>The first island they went in New World is Punk Hazard, the place where Aokiji and Akainu,
        the two admirals, who fought for fleet admiral. Aokiji lose and Akainu became the next fleet
        admiral after Sengoku. ANd Blackbeard replace Whitebear's position in being
        the four emperor. Luffy meet Law who was the new Shichibukai. Law made a deal with
        Luffy to bring down one of the four emperor: Kaidou. The first step is to defeat Doflamingo,
        a strong Shichibukai who is working for Kaidou in making man-made devil fruit. Luffy and
        Law with the coming of Smoker, now vice admiral, beats Caesar who was the scientist in making man-made devil fruit.
        Law captured Caesar to threaten Doflamingo to abandon the title of Shichibukai. Doflamingo comes
        to Punk Hazard and only found Smoker, who helped them beause he found the justice he's looking for.
        Doflamingo defeated Smoker easily but Aokiji, former admiral, saved him.
       </p>
       <p>
        Luffy and his crew went to Dressrose to fought against Doflamingo, a Shichibukai and celestial dragon.
        Luffy and Law fought together and defeated Doflamingo with Luffy's new fourth gear. Akainu sent 
        Fujitora, the new admiral, to capture Luffy, but he refused becuase Luffy overthrow Doflamingo, a dictator
        of Dressrosa who ensalved them for ten years. And Fujitora proposed a bill to abandon the existence
        of Shichibukai.
       </p>
       <p>Sanji and half of the crew we in Zou becuase of the attact of Big Mom Pirate
        , another one of the four emperors. There Chopper use his medical skills saved the Mink Tribe.
        However, one cadre of Big Mom finds Sanji and inform him of his marriage with Big Mom's 
        thirty-fifth daughter and the seventy-sixty child, Charlotte Pudding becuase Sanji was the third
        male of Vinsmoke Family. To save his comrades, Sanji went and leave the Straw Hat.
        When Luffy comes, he disagreed and went with another half of the crew to save Sanji and 
        let Zoro leading another half with the two kings of Mink Tribe to go to Wano Kingdom to undercover
        under Kaidou's territory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luffy and half of his crew comes into Big Mom's territory and finally convinced Sanji back to
        their team. In the mean time, Luffy even destroys the wedding ceremony and fought with Big Mom.
        But Luffy and his crew, even with the help of Vinsmoke family and Capone Bage(one of the 
        worst generations), are still no match with Big Mom. Fortunately, Big Mom is severly addict to sweets.
        She wasn't able to eat the wedding cake and all those sweets since those were destoryed. She then
        goes wild, and Luffy and all his people are going to escape. All of Big Mom's children come to fight with
        the Straw Hats. With the treat of all those people, Luffy goes to fight with Katakuri, the strongest 
        and the second child of Big Mom, alone. One the other hand, Big Mom's sickness was gradually healed
        by his eledest son, Charlotte Perospero. Luffy and Katakuri fight hard. Even Luffy comes with a new mode, 
        it's still hard to beat him. But as they fight, they develop the relationship of being friends. If they are not being in this 
        situtaion, they may have been friends. At last, Katakuri "lose" to Luffy and let go of him. On the other hand,
        Jinbei, who was a former Shichibukai and Ace's friend that developed a friendly relationship with Luffy, helps the rest
        of the crew and are considered on of them now. Jinbei and Sanji and other fight togther that can push back Big Mom a little.
        Finally, with the help of everyone, the Straw Hats were able to escape. 
    </p>
    <p>With being so famous of esaping Big Mom, defeated Doflamingo, and the alliance with Law, Luffy
        was given a nickname of being the fifth emperor and his bounty has rised to 15 billion belly.
    </p>
    <p>Luffy and his crew reunite with Zoro at the Wano Kingdom.</p>
    <p>Here in Wano Kingdom, Luffy wana set free of the people who were being enslaved by Kaidou
        and his people. Here he meet with Law, Kid, and Killer(one of the worst generations). 
        And Big Mom comes to kill Luffy, so now Luffy is going against two emperors of the sea. 
        Luffy, Zoro, Killer, Law, and Kid, five of the worst generations, come togther and fight for freedom
        and for self. Luffy, Law, and Kid all experienced another stage of their devil fruit: awakening. Their
        power is strong and their ability has a wider range either in attacking or controlling. Luffy even 
        got fifth gear. Using haki and fifth gear, Luffy finally defeated Kaidou; Law and Kid defeated Big Mom.
        There are no informationa about Kaidou and Big Mom are alive or not.  
        After this incident, everyone got another big upgrade in their bounty. Luffy, Kid, Law all get 
        fourty billion of bounty and Luffy replace Kaidou in being the new emperor of the sea.
