    <p class="two">Franky was the seventh member and the repairer of the ship. He is more talented in Usopp
        in building and repairing ship. He was an orphan before and was adopted by Mr. Tom. Mr. Tom 
        gives him a home and brothers and teaches him all the skills about ship. Mr.Tom was honored in 
        being the chief engineer of the train that opeartes on sea. 
        But Mr. Tom was later sent to jail and was going to be executed becuase he was the builder of 
        Gold D. Rodger's ship. Franky stand on the railroad tract, hoping he can stop the train; but he was blown away.
        He wake up on an old ship and use the metals over there to replace is injured parts. So now he is a 
        little bit robotic. 
    </p>
    <p>During the incident of Robin, he was also taken becuase CP9 suspect that he has the blue print 
        of Pluto, one of the ancient weapon that can destory one island in a blow. In Enies Lobby, Franky 
        showed the blue print to them and burn it in order to buy some time for Luffy to come. It was 
        burned but he memorize it already. After this incident, he joined the crew and make a new ship to 
        replace Merry. 
    </p>
    <p>After the promise of two years, Franky become stronger. He transformed more of his body into 
        metals and make upgrades. He could even burst laser now.
